This is currently a beta for the project which should recolect data from different videogame stores to compare, currently the code does it manually  and only from Steam
but it can be fixed using datetime on python so the code executes once per day, i didn't do it based on the fact of just having one scrapper currently

If you can think of any functionality I could add to the proyect just let me know at my email mrmistergd@protonmail.com
